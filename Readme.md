# HardwareIcons
A set of svg icons made for representing computer hardware as well as a few other related icons. This was created for my own Rainmeter skins but I'm making it available for others to use.

A detailed list of all icons included, as well as their Unicode code points, can be found in [FontTable.md.](./FontTable.md)

## Building
The font files can be built using FontForge and the Python files found in this repository. FontForge is required.

The command I use is: `"C:\Program Files (x86)\FontForgeBuilds\bin\fontforge.exe" -script .\generateFontFiles.py`. Replace the first part with wherever you installed FontForge.

`generateFontTable.py` is a Python script that will generate the font table file. Only Python is required for this script.

## Disclaimer
I'm not a graphic designer. Just an amateur who stubbornly struggled with Inkscape until something passable was created.
